# About #

This is a set of GNU Emacs configuration files (and some related stuff) that I
use. You probably don't want to use it as a whole, but some code snippets or
configuration tricks may be useful.

## Compatibility ##

I usually build Emacs from bzr, so code should be compatible with latest
trunk, but is not guaranteed to work good with release versions (though, for
the time of this writing everything, except for trunk-specific stuff, works
fine with GNU Emacs 23.3).
