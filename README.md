# About #

This is a set of GNU Emacs configuration files (and some related stuff) that I
use. You probably don't want to use it as a whole, but some code snippets or
configuration tricks may be useful.

## Compatibility ##

Currently I use this configuration with GNU Emacs 24.2.1, except for some
packages like org-mode or gnus, trunk versions of which are used instead of
ones included in Emacs distribution.
