# About #

This is a set of GNU Emacs configuration files (and some related stuff) that I
use. You probably don't want to use it as a whole, but some code snippets or
configuration tricks may be useful.

## Compatibility ##

I use this configuration with Emacs built from trunk (currently 24.3.50.1),
but is should work on current stable release (24.3.1).
